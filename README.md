### Day 1: November 24, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Introduction to Machine Learnning. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning. Model and Cost function.

**Details**:

 - Started Andrew Ng's course "Machine Learning" on Coursera 
 - Supervised Learning: Dataset where we know the correct output, Unsupervised Learning: No idea what our result sould look like. 
 - Model Representation: Training set notation, Hypothesis function *h(x)*. 
 - Cost Function: To measure the accuracy of hpythesis function.
 - Contour plot: A contour plot is a graph that contains many contour lines. A contour line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line.
